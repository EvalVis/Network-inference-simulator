# Network inference simulator
Project is made in Lithuanian language.
Project simulates network inference by encoding message with extra data given in generator matrix.
Encoded message is then sent via untrusted channel (which is given the probability to flip each bit independently of others). The program then decodes the message
with the help of parity-check matrix.
